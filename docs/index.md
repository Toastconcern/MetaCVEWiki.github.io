## What is rooting?

**Rooting** is the process of gaining administrative (superuser) access to the Android operating system, enabling users to bypass manufacturer and carrier restrictions and modify core system files and settings.

Popular uses for rooting include:

* Removing preinstalled bloatware or replacing/editing system files. <!--using [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) -->
* Overclocking or undervolting CPU/GPU for performance or battery life.
* Demetafying your headset.
* Modding Games
* And of course more...

## What does this guide install?

The current only method will not modify any critical partitions, as we are still limited by the locked bootloader and because of this you will need to rerun the exploit every reboot to regain root.
